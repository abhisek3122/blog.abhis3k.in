After a long time, approximately 1-2 years, I am taking a break from all my work stuff. My day generally starts around 6-7 AM, where I used to travel for 1.5 hours to my college. There, I would meet friends, have fun, and then return in the evening around 6-7 PM to continue with my internship. This has been the usual routine I have been following. In between these days, I used to keep learning something new, which keeps me excited all the time.

In December 2023, I took a month off from the company where I have been working, both for a break and to focus on completing my college exams. During this break, I decided to complete a few certifications, one of which is the INE ICCA.

#### Chapter 1: <br/>Why, INE ICCA? {#chapter1}

That's a really good question. When there are numerous certifications offered directly by cloud providers, why should I choose this one? There's a reason behind it. My initial plan was to complete the eJPT certification. While checking out the voucher, I had the option to add the ICCA voucher at a discounted price. The ICCA certification covers 50-60% of the content found in other certifications. Regardless, our goal is to explore more and learn, so I decided to purchase this one as well.

#### Chapter 2: <br/>What did they cover? {#chapter2}

To be honest, it was very basic fundamentals that are related to cloud computing. It covers all the necessary basic concepts with these three major providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), showing their workflows, basic setups, and necessary features and options.

To list some of the topics:
Types of clouds and their layers, Fundamentals of cost management, Monitoring and Alerts, Security and Compliance.

#### Chapter 3: <br/>How did the examination go? {#chapter3}

It certainly has two parts: one consists of multiple-choice questions with 46 questions, requiring more than 70% correct answers, and the other is a lab section with four questions, each needing two or more points to pass. However, the scoring is not exactly as described; there are some variations. Attendees are required to pass all the cases.

#### Chapter 4: <br/>Is it worth spending the time? {#chapter4}

It is a subjective question; it really depends on your skills. If you're a person who doesn't know about cloud computing, you can check this out. If you have an understanding at a basic level, I would suggest taking up an advanced-level certification.

I took around 4-5 days to prepare; I felt that it was enough in my case as I had some idea about cloud computing previously. However, if you're new, I would suggest spending some more time preparing for the exam.

#### Chapter 5: <br/>the, certificate? {#chapter5}

It generates immediately after the examinations are completed and when you have the minimum required scores.
